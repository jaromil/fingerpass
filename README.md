# Fingerpass

This software is inspired by the article "A fingerprint based
crypto-biometric system for secure communication" published on 22 May
2018 and available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08399

In particular, this software tries to implement the "Feature
Extraction" transormation described in section 2.1 to
deterministically extract a number of quantized distance vectors based
on NIST-compatible minutiae from a fingerprint scan.

This software is an experiment, don't use in production.
